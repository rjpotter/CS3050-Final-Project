# CS3050-Final-Project

## Description
The game Stratego. Stratego is a classic board game of battlefield strategy that combines elements of stealth, tactics, and surprise. Designed for two players, the game represents a battle between two armies, with the objective of capturing the opponent's flag or eliminating their ability to move. Each player controls 40 pieces representing individual officer and soldier ranks in an army, with each piece's rank hidden from the opponent. Pieces have varying ranks and powers, and the setup is secret at the start of the game. Players move their pieces across a board, with the goal of attacking the opponentâ€™s pieces to discover their rank and capture the flag. The catch is that lower-ranked pieces can defeat higher ranks in specific scenarios, adding a layer of strategic depth and bluffing.

## Rules
- **Setup**: Each player places their 40 pieces on their side of the 10x10 board, hiding the ranks from their opponent. The arrangement can vary, but pieces must be placed in the four rows closest to the player.
- **Objective**: Capture the opponent's flag or trap all of their movable pieces so they cannot make a move.
- **Movement**: Players take turns moving one piece per turn. Pieces can move one square horizontally or vertically (not diagonally), except for the Scout, which can move any distance in a straight line.
- **Attacks**: To attack, move your piece into a square occupied by an opposing piece. Both players then reveal their ranks; the lower-ranked piece is removed from the board. If the ranks are equal, both pieces are removed.
- **Special Pieces**:
  - The Flag is immobile and must be protected.
  - Bombs destroy any attacking piece except Miners.
  - Miners can defuse Bombs, removing them without being destroyed.
  - The Spy can defeat the highest-ranking piece, the Marshal, if the Spy attacks.
- **No Entry Zones**: Two "lakes" in the center of the board are impassable and pieces cannot move through or onto these squares.
- **Winning**: The game ends when one player captures the opponent's flag or the opponent cannot make any legal moves.
- **Prohibited Moves**: Pieces cannot move back and forth between the same two squares repeatedly (two-square rule) to avoid indefinite continuation of the game.

### Task Priorities and Details

### 1. Semi-random Human Board Setup
- **Priority**: Nice to Have
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Notes**: Implement a method for players to place their pieces on the board in a semi-random arrangement, potentially using strategies similar to those developed for the computer player setup.
- **Status**: Pending

### 2. Scout Movement Function
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Notes**: Develop functionality allowing Scouts to move any number of squares vertically or horizontally, not being limited to the one-square movement of other pieces, similar to a Rook in chess.
- **Status**: Pending

### 3. Semi-random Computer Board Setup
- **Priority**: Nice to Have
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Notes**: Enhance the computer player's board setup to include semi-random placement of pieces to vary gameplay and increase difficulty.
- **Status**: In Progress

### 4. GUI Interface for Making Moves
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Notes**: Create a graphical user interface that allows players to make moves by selecting a piece and then selecting the target square.
- **Status**: Completed

### 5. Display Board in GUI
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Notes**: The current state of the game should be visually represented in the GUI, showing piece positions in a manner that is easy to understand.
- **Status**: Completed

### 6. Move Validation
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Notes**: Implement checks to validate player moves, ensuring they adhere to game rules, and prompt the player to make another move if the initial move is invalid.
- **Status**: In Progress

### Task Priorities and Details

### 1. Human Player Movement Function
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Notes**: Implement functionality to process and execute player's move commands, updating the game state with the new positions of moved pieces.
- **Status**: Complete. Some testing done and passes all tests thrown at it thus far. Will likely do more testing when graphics are added.

### 2. Computer Player Movement Function
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Notes**: Develop a function that allows the computer to select and perform moves randomly, updating the game state after each move.
- **Status**: Complete. Some testing done. More testing will be completed when interface to play is further developed.

### 3. CLI Interface for the Game
- **Priority**: Nice to Have
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Notes**: Develop a simple CLI for the game to facilitate testing and early gameplay experiences. This interface should support game start, displaying the board, and taking player input.
- **Status**: In Progress. Basic CLI structure is in place, including board display and initial input handling. Further refinement and feature additions are underway.

### 4. Make Game Playable
- **Priority**: Nice to Have
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Notes**: Ensure that the game can alternate turns between the human and computer players, applying game rules to determine win conditions.
- **Status**: In Progress. Turn-taking mechanics are partially implemented. Completion of player movement functions and integration with game win conditions is pending.

### 5. Graphics: Fully Rendered
- **Priority**: Must Have
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Notes**: All game textures should be rendered within the game's GUI. Interactivity is not a requirement for this sprint but will be addressed in future development.
- **Status**: Pending. Framework and window initialization are complete. Graphics rendering for game elements is the next step.

### Task Priorities and Details

1. **Initialize Board**
   - **Priority**: Essential
   - **Difficulty**: Easy
   - **Notes**: Each player will have a pre-set starting position.
   - **Status**: Completed. The board is initialized with troops in their starting positions for both human and computer players.

2. **Cell Type Enum**
   - **Priority**: Essential
   - **Difficulty**: Easy
   - **Notes**: Define enum types for different cell states or contents.
   - **Status**: Completed. The `Cell` enum classifies all possible cell types, including troops, bombs, and the flag.

3. **Computer that Can Move Pieces (basic)**
   - **Priority**: Important
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Notes**: Moves can be mostly random, scouts will not be able to do non-standard moves.
   - **Status**: Completed. Basic infrastructure for move generation is in place, though specific logic for moves, including scouts, is pending.

4. **Learn PyArcade**
   - **Priority**: Important
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Notes**: Successful if we can get a window with a single graphic.
   - **Status**: In Progress. We have successfully built the framework and initialized a window. 

5. **List of Edge Cases**
   - **Priority**: Nice to have
   - **Difficulty**: Medium
   - **Notes**: Get the list of all the comparisons for every situation (water, troop comparisons like Spy->Marshal, etc.).
   - **Status**: In Progress. Basic comparisons and some edge cases have been implemented, with more complex scenarios to follow.

6. **Game End Detection**
   - **Priority**: Nice to have
   - **Difficulty**: Easy
   - **Notes**: Just detecting if a troop captures the enemy flag.
   - **Status**: Completed. Game can detect the capture of the flag.

7. **Troop Type Comparison**
   - **Priority**: Nice to have
   - **Difficulty**: Easy
   - **Notes**: Basically deciding who wins based on a troop attacking another.
   - **Status**: Completed for basic cases. Additional logic for more complex troop interactions is in development.
